You are an expert software architect tasked with creating detailed technical specifications for software development projects.

Your specifications will be used as direct input for planning & code generation AI systems, so they must be precise, structured, and comprehensive.

First, carefully review the project request:

<project_request>
I'm creating a budget app for therapists in barcelona. It should have number of clients, number of session/month/client, session rate, a table to list personal expenses, a table to list professional expenses, a net income section with tax calculation (based on subtracting professional expenses, total current savings, and savings goals (in 6 months). 


This is in spain, so update the tax settings with VAT of 21% (calculated per-session) and add a vat paid per month section. Calculate tax rate based off the autonomo structure:

YOUR GLOBAL TAX RATE
The variable rates applicable to the taxable amount resulting from all your personal and business matters (after allowances and deductions are computed) can be seen in the tables below.
Income Tax in Spain varies slightly from one autonomous region to the other. The table is a pretty good approximation.
 
IRPF (Personal Income Tax) Scale
Taxable Base (up to)TaxRest ( up to)Tax Rate0,00 €012450.00 €19%12450 €2365.50€20200.00 €24%20200.00 €4225.50€35200.00 €30,00%35200.00 €8725.50€60000.00 €37,00%60000.00 €17901.50€45,00%

At the bottom of the page, you should have:
1. Calculate monthly gross income
2. Calculate professional expenses
3. Calculate monthly tax rate
4. Calculate monthly income tax
5. Calculate monthly vat
6. Calculate monthly personal expenses
7. Calculate net income = gross income minus professional expenses, monthly income tax,  monthly vat , and monthly personal expenses
8. Calculate how much above or below the target savings we'll be in 6 months based on all that

It should use vercel postgres (not supabase).
</project_request>

Next, carefully review the project rules:

<project_rules>
# Project Instructions

Use specification and guidelines as you build the app.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever I ask for.

You will see <ai_context> tags in the code. These are context tags that you should use to help you understand the codebase.

## Overview

This is a web app template.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, Framer Motion
- Backend: Postgres, Vercel Postgres, Drizzle ORM, Server Actions
- Auth: Clerk
- Payments: Stripe
- Analytics: PostHog
- Deployment: Vercel

## Project Structure

- `actions` - Server actions
  - `db` - Database related actions
  - Other actions
- `app` - Next.js app router
  - `api` - API routes
  - `route` - An example route
    - `_components` - One-off components for the route
    - `layout.tsx` - Layout for the route
    - `page.tsx` - Page for the route
- `components` - Shared components
  - `ui` - UI components
  - `utilities` - Utility components
- `db` - Database
  - `schema` - Database schemas
- `lib` - Library code
  - `hooks` - Custom hooks
- `prompts` - Prompt files
- `public` - Static assets
- `types` - Type definitions

## Rules

Follow these rules when building the app.

### General Rules

- Use `@` to import anything from the app unless otherwise specified
- Use kebab case for all files and folders unless otherwise specified
- Don't update shadcn components unless otherwise specified

#### Env Rules

- If you update environment variables, update the `.env.example` file
- All environment variables should go in `.env.local`
- Do not expose environment variables to the frontend
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables that need to be accessed from the frontend
- You may import environment variables in server actions and components by using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`

#### Type Rules

Follow these rules when working with types.

- When importing types, use `@/types`
- Name files like `example-types.ts`
- All types should go in `types`
- Make sure to export the types in `types/index.ts`
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases
- If referring to db types, use `@/db/schema` such as `SelectTodo` from `todos-schema.ts`

An example of a type:

`types/actions-types.ts`

```ts
export type ActionState<T> =
  | { isSuccess: true; message: string; data: T }
  | { isSuccess: false; message: string; data?: never }
```

And exporting it:

`types/index.ts`

```ts
export * from "./actions-types"
```

### Frontend Rules

Follow these rules when working on the frontend.

It uses Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, and Framer Motion.

#### General Rules

- Use `lucide-react` for icons
- useSidebar must be used within a SidebarProvider

#### Components

- Use divs instead of other html tags unless otherwise specified
- Separate the main parts of a component's html with an extra blank line for visual spacing
- Always tag a component with either `use server` or `use client` at the top, including layouts and pages
- You can assume all shadcn components are installed and available to use. I haven't included them in the project structure for brevity.

##### Organization

- All components be named using kebab case like `example-component.tsx` unless otherwise specified
- Put components in `/_components` in the route if one-off components
- Put components in `/components` from the root if shared components

##### Data Fetching

- Fetch data in server components and pass the data down as props to client components.
- Use server actions from `/actions` to mutate data.

##### Server Components

- Use `"use server"` at the top of the file.
- Implement Suspense for asynchronous data fetching to show loading states while data is being fetched.
- If no asynchronous logic is required for a given server component, you do not need to wrap the component in `<Suspense>`. You can simply return the final UI directly since there is no async boundary needed.
- If asynchronous fetching is required, you can use a `<Suspense>` boundary and a fallback to indicate a loading state while data is loading.
- Server components cannot be imported into client components. If you want to use a server component in a client component, you must pass the as props using the "children" prop
- params in server pages should be awaited such as `const { courseId } = await params` where the type is `params: Promise<{ courseId: string }>`

Example of a server layout:

```tsx
"use server"

export default async function ExampleServerLayout({
  children
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return children
}
```

Example of a server page (with async logic):

```tsx
"use server"

import { Suspense } from "react"
import { SomeAction } from "@/actions/some-actions"
import SomeComponent from "./_components/some-component"
import SomeSkeleton from "./_components/some-skeleton"

export default async function ExampleServerPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<SomeSkeleton className="some-class" />}>
      <SomeComponentFetcher />
    </Suspense>
  )
}

async function SomeComponentFetcher() {
  const { data } = await SomeAction()
  return <SomeComponent className="some-class" initialData={data || []} />
}
```

Example of a server page (no async logic required):

```tsx
"use server"

import SomeClientComponent from "./_components/some-client-component"

// In this case, no asynchronous work is being done, so no Suspense or fallback is required.
export default async function ExampleServerPage() {
  return <SomeClientComponent initialData={[]} />
}
```

Example of a server component:

```tsx
"use server"

interface ExampleServerComponentProps {
  // Your props here
}

export async function ExampleServerComponent({
  props
}: ExampleServerComponentProps) {
  // Your code here
}
```

##### Client Components

- Use `"use client"` at the top of the file
- Client components can safely rely on props passed down from server components, or handle UI interactions without needing <Suspense> if there’s no async logic.
- Never use server actions in client components. If you need to create a new server action, create it in `/actions`

Example of a client page:

```tsx
"use client"

export default function ExampleClientPage() {
  // Your code here
}
```

Example of a client component:

```tsx
"use client"

interface ExampleClientComponentProps {
  initialData: any[]
}

export default function ExampleClientComponent({
  initialData
}: ExampleClientComponentProps) {
  // Client-side logic here
  return <div>{initialData.length} items</div>
}
```

### Backend Rules

Follow these rules when working on the backend.

It uses Postgres, Supabase, Drizzle ORM, and Server Actions.

#### General Rules

- Never generate migrations. You do not have to do anything in the `db/migrations` folder inluding migrations and metadata. Ignore it.

#### Organization

#### Schemas

- When importing schemas, use `@/db/schema`
- Name files like `example-schema.ts`
- All schemas should go in `db/schema`
- Make sure to export the schema in `db/schema/index.ts`
- Make sure to add the schema to the `schema` object in `db/db.ts`
- If using a userId, always use `userId: text("user_id").notNull()`
- Always include createdAt and updatedAt columns in all tables
- Make sure to cascade delete when necessary
- Use enums for columns that have a limited set of possible values such as:

```ts
import { pgEnum } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"

export const membershipEnum = pgEnum("membership", ["free", "pro"])

membership: membershipEnum("membership").notNull().default("free")
```

Example of a schema:

`db/schema/todos-schema.ts`

```ts
import { boolean, pgTable, text, timestamp, uuid } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"

export const todosTable = pgTable("todos", {
  id: uuid("id").defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  userId: text("user_id").notNull(),
  content: text("content").notNull(),
  completed: boolean("completed").default(false).notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at")
    .defaultNow()
    .notNull()
    .$onUpdate(() => new Date())
})

export type InsertTodo = typeof todosTable.$inferInsert
export type SelectTodo = typeof todosTable.$inferSelect
```

And exporting it:

`db/schema/index.ts`

```ts
export * from "./todos-schema"
```

And adding it to the schema in `db/db.ts`:

`db/db.ts`

```ts
import { todosTable } from "@/db/schema"

const schema = {
  todos: todosTable
}
```

And a more complex schema:

```ts
import { pgTable, text, timestamp, uuid } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"

export const chatsTable = pgTable("chats", {
  id: uuid("id").defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  userId: text("user_id").notNull(),
  name: text("name").notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at")
    .defaultNow()
    .notNull()
    .$onUpdate(() => new Date())
})

export type InsertChat = typeof chatsTable.$inferInsert
export type SelectChat = typeof chatsTable.$inferSelect
```

```ts
import { pgEnum, pgTable, text, timestamp, uuid } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"
import { chatsTable } from "./chats-schema"

export const roleEnum = pgEnum("role", ["assistant", "user"])

export const messagesTable = pgTable("messages", {
  id: uuid("id").defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  chatId: uuid("chat_id")
    .references(() => chatsTable.id, { onDelete: "cascade" })
    .notNull(),
  content: text("content").notNull(),
  role: roleEnum("role").notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at")
    .defaultNow()
    .notNull()
    .$onUpdate(() => new Date())
})

export type InsertMessage = typeof messagesTable.$inferInsert
export type SelectMessage = typeof messagesTable.$inferSelect
```

And exporting it:

`db/schema/index.ts`

```ts
export * from "./chats-schema"
export * from "./messages-schema"
```

And adding it to the schema in `db/db.ts`:

`db/db.ts`

```ts
import { chatsTable, messagesTable } from "@/db/schema"

const schema = {
  chats: chatsTable,
  messages: messagesTable
}
```

#### Server Actions

- When importing actions, use `@/actions` or `@/actions/db` if db related
- DB related actions should go in the `actions/db` folder
- Other actions should go in the `actions` folder
- Name files like `example-actions.ts`
- All actions should go in the `actions` folder
- Only write the needed actions
- Return an ActionState with the needed data type from actions
- Include Action at the end of function names `Ex: exampleFunction -> exampleFunctionAction`
- Actions should return a Promise<ActionState<T>>
- Sort in CRUD order: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Make sure to return undefined as the data type if the action is not supposed to return any data
- **Date Handling:** For columns defined as `PgDateString` (or any date string type), always convert JavaScript `Date` objects to ISO strings using `.toISOString()` before performing operations (e.g., comparisons or insertions). This ensures value type consistency and prevents type errors.

```ts
export type ActionState<T> =
  | { isSuccess: true; message: string; data: T }
  | { isSuccess: false; message: string; data?: never }
```

Example of an action:

`actions/db/todos-actions.ts`

```ts
"use server"

import { db } from "@/db/db"
import { InsertTodo, SelectTodo, todosTable } from "@/db/schema/todos-schema"
import { ActionState } from "@/types"
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm"

export async function createTodoAction(
  todo: InsertTodo
): Promise<ActionState<SelectTodo>> {
  try {
    const [newTodo] = await db.insert(todosTable).values(todo).returning()
    return {
      isSuccess: true,
      message: "Todo created successfully",
      data: newTodo
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating todo:", error)
    return { isSuccess: false, message: "Failed to create todo" }
  }
}

export async function getTodosAction(
  userId: string
): Promise<ActionState<SelectTodo[]>> {
  try {
    const todos = await db.query.todos.findMany({
      where: eq(todosTable.userId, userId)
    })
    return {
      isSuccess: true,
      message: "Todos retrieved successfully",
      data: todos
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error getting todos:", error)
    return { isSuccess: false, message: "Failed to get todos" }
  }
}

export async function updateTodoAction(
  id: string,
  data: Partial<InsertTodo>
): Promise<ActionState<SelectTodo>> {
  try {
    const [updatedTodo] = await db
      .update(todosTable)
      .set(data)
      .where(eq(todosTable.id, id))
      .returning()

    return {
      isSuccess: true,
      message: "Todo updated successfully",
      data: updatedTodo
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error updating todo:", error)
    return { isSuccess: false, message: "Failed to update todo" }
  }
}

export async function deleteTodoAction(id: string): Promise<ActionState<void>> {
  try {
    await db.delete(todosTable).where(eq(todosTable.id, id))
    return {
      isSuccess: true,
      message: "Todo deleted successfully",
      data: undefined
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error deleting todo:", error)
    return { isSuccess: false, message: "Failed to delete todo" }
  }
}
```

### Auth Rules

Follow these rules when working on auth.

It uses Clerk for authentication.

#### General Rules

- Import the auth helper with `import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"` in server components
- await the auth helper in server actions

### Payments Rules

Follow these rules when working on payments.

It uses Stripe for payments.

### Analytics Rules

Follow these rules when working on analytics.

It uses PostHog for analytics.

# Storage Rules

Follow these rules when working with Supabase Storage.

It uses Supabase Storage for file uploads, downloads, and management.

## General Rules

- Always use environment variables for bucket names to maintain consistency across environments
- Never hardcode bucket names in the application code
- Always handle file size limits and allowed file types at the application level
- Use the `upsert` method instead of `upload` when you want to replace existing files
- Always implement proper error handling for storage operations
- Use content-type headers when uploading files to ensure proper file handling

## Organization

### Buckets

- Name buckets in kebab-case: `user-uploads`, `profile-images`
- Create separate buckets for different types of files (e.g., `profile-images`, `documents`, `attachments`)
- Document bucket purposes in a central location
- Set appropriate bucket policies (public/private) based on access requirements
- Implement RLS (Row Level Security) policies for buckets that need user-specific access
- Make sure to let me know instructions for setting up RLS policies on Supabase since you can't do this yourself, including the SQL scripts I need to run in the editor

### File Structure

- Organize files in folders based on their purpose and ownership
- Use predictable, collision-resistant naming patterns
- Structure: `{bucket}/{userId}/{purpose}/{filename}`
- Example: `profile-images/123e4567-e89b/avatar/profile.jpg`
- Include timestamps in filenames when version history is important
- Example: `documents/123e4567-e89b/contracts/2024-02-13-contract.pdf`

## Actions

- When importing storage actions, use `@/actions/storage`
- Name files like `example-storage-actions.ts`
- Include Storage at the end of function names `Ex: uploadFile -> uploadFileStorage`
- Follow the same ActionState pattern as DB actions

Example of a storage action:

```ts
"use server"

import { createClientComponentClient } from "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs"
import { ActionState } from "@/types"

export async function uploadFileStorage(
  bucket: string,
  path: string,
  file: File
): Promise<ActionState<{ path: string }>> {
  try {
    const supabase = createClientComponentClient()

    const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
      .from(bucket)
      .upload(path, file, {
        upsert: false,
        contentType: file.type
      })

    if (error) throw error

    return {
      isSuccess: true,
      message: "File uploaded successfully",
      data: { path: data.path }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error uploading file:", error)
    return { isSuccess: false, message: "Failed to upload file" }
  }
}
```

## File Handling

### Upload Rules

- Always validate file size before upload
- Implement file type validation using both extension and MIME type
- Generate unique filenames to prevent collisions
- Set appropriate content-type headers
- Handle existing files appropriately (error or upsert)

Example validation:

```ts
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB
const ALLOWED_TYPES = ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/webp"]

function validateFile(file: File): boolean {
  if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
    throw new Error("File size exceeds limit")
  }

  if (!ALLOWED_TYPES.includes(file.type)) {
    throw new Error("File type not allowed")
  }

  return true
}
```

### Download Rules

- Always handle missing files gracefully
- Implement proper error handling for failed downloads
- Use signed URLs for private files

### Delete Rules

- Implement soft deletes when appropriate
- Clean up related database records when deleting files
- Handle bulk deletions carefully
- Verify ownership before deletion
- Always delete all versions/transforms of a file

## Security

### Bucket Policies

- Make buckets private by default
- Only make buckets public when absolutely necessary
- Use RLS policies to restrict access to authorized users
- Example RLS policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own files"
ON storage.objects
FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

### Access Control

- Generate short-lived signed URLs for private files
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use separate buckets for public and private files
- Never expose internal file paths
- Validate user permissions before any operation

## Error Handling

- Implement specific error types for common storage issues
- Always provide meaningful error messages
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Log storage errors separately for monitoring

## Optimization

- Implement progressive upload for large files
- Clean up temporary files and failed uploads
- Use batch operations when handling multiple files
</project_rules>

Finally, carefully review the starter template:

<starter_template>
{{insert_template_here}}
</starter_template>

Your task is to generate a comprehensive technical specification based on this information.

Before creating the final specification, analyze the project requirements and plan your approach. Wrap your thought process in <specification_planning> tags, considering the following:

1. Core system architecture and key workflows
2. Project structure and organization
3. Detailed feature specifications

11. Testing strategy

For each of these areas:
- Provide a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be included
- List potential challenges or areas needing clarification
- Consider potential edge cases and error handling scenarios

In your analysis, be sure to:
- Break down complex features into step-by-step flows
- Identify areas that require further clarification or have potential risks
